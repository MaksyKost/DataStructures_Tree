# DataStructures_Tree
Implementation and benchmarking of Tree-Based Data Structures (C++).

# Data Structures: Tree

This repository was created for the Data Structures course at Wrocław University of Science and Technology.

## 📌 Project Description

The goal of this project is to implement **Splay Tree**, **T-Tree**, **Dancing Tree** and  **AVL Tree**. 

In addition to implementation, we will develop both **CLI** and **GUI** interfaces, as well as conduct **performance testing** for fundamental operations across all tree structures.

## ⚙️ Implemented Operations

The following operations will be implemented for all tree structures:

- **insert** – Inserts a new node into the tree.
- **delete** – Removes a node from the tree.
- **search** – Finds a node in the tree.

## 🧪 Benchmarking

Performance analysis for all tree structures includes:

- Measuring execution times for different dataset sizes.
- Storing benchmarking results in the `results/` directory as `.txt` files.
- Visualizing and analyzing performance metrics in the final report.

## 🛠️ Technologies

- **Language**: C++
- **Development**: Custom implementations from scratch (without STL containers)
- **Interfaces**: Command-line (CLI) & graphical (GUI)
